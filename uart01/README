See top level README for more information on documentation for this
chip and board.  And for instructions on how to load and run this
example.

UART0_TXD is on GPIO1.11.

Standard 16550 register set.

24Mhz/16/115200 is 13, but the right answer is 26 for the divisor.
They talk about a clock divided by 2 but that just makes it worse
not better.  Anyway a divisor 26 gives us 115200.

115200 8N1

This spits out 012345670123456... as fast as it can, forever.

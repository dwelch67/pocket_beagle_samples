See top level README for more information on documentation for this
chip and board.  And for instructions on how to load and run this
example.

This took a bit.  Needed a wake up instead of a clock enable.
GPIO1.11 comes out of reset as a GPIO, we need to change it to be
mode 0 which is UART0_TXD.  GPIO1.10 is UART0_RXD in mode0 as well
will get to that soon.

Standard 16550 register set.

There is a times 2 somewhere, 24Mhz/16/115200 is 13 but we need a
divisor of 26.  Something to figure out.

This spits out 012345670123456... as fast as it can, forever.

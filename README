Internal SRAM 0x402F0400 to 0x402FFFFF  64K - 0x400

Assuming this is a GP (General Purpose) processor (vs HS).

The Initialization chapter has a section on Memory Booting and
MMC/SD cards and a section on Image Format (for the data on the
sd card).

Starting with RAW mode offset/sector 0x0000 on the SD card.

Assuming/using GP Non-XIP (mmc/sd) Memory Booting.  We need two
TOC's and then a GP header then our code.

The TOC is described in that chapter, 0x20 bytes each TOC the first
has specific values for a CHSETTINGS entry.  The second all 0xFFs.
Then two magic values, and then the GP header which is two words
then our program the two words being length and where to copy
the program.  There is almost 64K of internal sram at 0x402F0400.

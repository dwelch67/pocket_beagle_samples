Baremetal examples for the PocketBeagle board

https://beagleboard.org/pocket

This board is based on the system in package

Octavo systems OSD3358-SM

Which includes in the package a texas instruments AM3358

http://www.ti.com/processors/sitara/arm-cortex-a8/am335x/overview.html

then look at the AM3358 then technical documents, under User guides
there is the Technical Reference Manual which is currently directly
linked here

http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/spruh73p/spruh73p.pdf

Note that all of these links are subject to change at any time.

Following the beagleboard path this page looks pretty good

We can see the LEDs are connected directly to GPIO pins.

LED Signal Name Proc Ball   SiP Ball
USR0    GPIO1_21    V15 P13
USR1    GPIO1_22    U15 T14
USR2    GPIO1_23    T15 R14
USR3    GPIO1_24    V16 P14

That github repo also has a schematic.

From the schematic the SYSBOOT pins are

0100000000011000

24MHz CLKOUT1 disabled boot sequence SPI0 MMC0 USB0 UART0

-------------------------------

The Initialization chapter has a section on Memory Booting and
MMC/SD cards and a section on Image Format (for the data on the
sd card).

Starting with RAW mode offset/sector 0x0000 on the SD card.

Assuming/using GP Non-XIP (mmc/sd) Memory Booting.  We need two
TOC's and then a GP header then our code.

The TOC is described in that chapter, 0x20 bytes each TOC the first
has specific values for a CHSETTINGS entry.  The second all 0xFFs.
Then two magic values, and then the GP header which is two words
then our program the two words being length and where to copy
the program.  There is almost 64K of internal sram at 0x402F0400.

0x00000040 ----
0x0000000C TOC 1
0x00000000

pad this out to 0x200 bytes

0x200: 0x00001000 length of program
0x204: 0x402F0400 destination address
0x208: software starts

I run Linux which can make this next part super easy, but also super
dangerous.  You need to mount the sd card in your development computer

sudo fdisk -l

to list the drives, remove the sd card run this, put it back on
run it again, you should see a new one show up like this one

Disk /dev/sdf: 1.9 GiB, 1967128576 bytes, 3842048 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

So /dev/sdf is the thing we care about, we are going to take over/trash
the sd card so dont use one you have other stuff on.  You can
repartition and format the drive again for use, but save anything there
you care about before doing this.  I wont put a line you can cut
and paste you need to figure out the device, if you hit the wrong one
say you hit your hard drive, you may lose/trash your hard drive so
you need to be VERY careful...You have been warned

replace the X with what you find.

sudo dd if=sdraw.bin of=/dev/sdX
1+1 records in
1+1 records out
776 bytes copied, 0.00248622 s, 312 kB/s

remove the sd card, put it in the pocket beagle and power on.

I have left a built sdraw.bin from blinker01 in the base directory
for you to try.  If that file works but your build doesnt then perhaps
it is a tools problem.  The four user leds should blink.

-----------

I would like to use the uart boot mode, but if the sd card is not
present then it boots into the onboard flash even though from the
boot order that doesnt necessarily makes sense.

-----------

There are other boot modes as well as a different SD card approach, but
will mess with those later, for now RAW MMC/SD is the mode of choice
each directory unless otherwise noted will create an sdraw.bin file
that you dd over to the sd card or use another tool as needed to do
low level/raw writes to the sd card.

-----------

See the TOOLCHAIN file for information on how to get the gnu toolchain
which what I used to build these examples.

The ti AM3358 page states this chip is based around an ARM Cortex-A8
core.  What we do with this information is gather some additional
important documents.

http://infocenter.arm.com

You might need to sacrifice an email address, you decide for yourself
if you are an ARM developer or not.

Under Cortex-A series processors on the left expand Cortex-A8 for
now we dont know which revision this is and yes it does matter you
certainly want the manual that goes with the revision that ti used
for this part.  Parhaps the most recent has documentation fixes but
be careful that the different revisions may have differences in features
or addresses or other.

I slide to the bottom of the page for the specific revision chosen
and get the pdf.

The TRM for the core (Cortex-A8) tells us this is an ARMv7-A so we
go back to the left side of the ARM page under ARM architecture,
Reference Manuals, ARMv7-AR (not the ARMv7-M that is not the same),
And get the pdf version of that.

------------

Start with the blinker examples.  Typically I/you want to start by
blinking an led which is the printf("Hello World\n"); of bare metal.
Working into using timers and verifying or discovering what the clock
frequency is.  From there you get a uart up, this can be tricky,
often is, and in the end it shouldnt have been that hard.  Fortunately
I did all this for you with some uart examples.  You could just skip
over that to the bootloader01 example.  This saves on the sd card
dance

1) unplug the board
2) remove the sd card
3) put the sd card in a reader in the development machine
4) write your new program to the sd card
5) sync (dont need to with this raw method)
6) unmount (dont need to with this raw method)
7) remove sd card from development computer
8) place sd card in board
9) power board

And you repeat that hundreds of times.

Or you can one time load the bootloader onto the flash, I have left
an already built binary for you bootloader.bin in this directory.
Write that as you would an sdraw.bin.  You will need a usb to 3.3Vttl
solution, google raspberry pi uart cable or get an ftdi breakout for
like $2 on ebay and some jumper cables for a few bucks.  Connect the
host uart TX to the boards UART 0 RX and the host uart RX to the boards
UART 0 TX.

I use minicom on linux you can use what you like, will leave it an
exercise to the reader on getting the uart up on the host, set to
115200 8N1 no flow control, etc...

When you have it all connected and power on the board you will see

12345678

SREC

On the console.  Open the notmain.srec file in this directory,
cut and paste the contents of this file into your uart terminal.

If happy the terminal will show

402F1000

after a few seconds. If no errors (0xBADBADxx) hit the g (as in go) key
in the console to tell the bootloader to start the program, it will
print the entry address (again) then run.  The notmain.srec in this
top level directory is blinker01 so it will blink the leds.

Each of the examples generates a notmain.srec file as well as sdraw.bin
so once you get the bootloader up and running you ideally no longer
need to remove the sd card during development.

The reset button on the pocket beagle works.  You have to press it for
10 seconds, plus, then release then press it for less than a second
and it resets/boots.  Hopefully someday I will maybe find what that
is connected to and reprogram it for a shorter period.  You can easily
just unplug and replug the board power (usb cable) in far less time
but puts wear and tear on the usb connector.  Goal is to avoid such
things, ideally just push a button to re-boot into the bootloader.

-------------

note, I got lucky, the mkraw.c and memmap in each directory need
to have matching start addresses.  The one in bootloader01 is different
from the other examples the bootloader needs to run out of the way
so that you can load examples in their normal place, so it runs near
the top of the SRAM leaving room for other programs lower in the
SRAM.  There is an additional hardcoded value in the bootloader that
matches with its unique memmap and mkraw.c that keeps you from
overwriting the bootloader while loading your program.

See top level README for more information on documentation for this
chip and board.  And for instructions on how to load and run this
example.

This is the first example meant to get some sign of life.  You
have to enable or at least see if the peripheral in question should
be enabled out of reset.  GPIO1 is not so you have to enable clocks to
it then you can use it.  This code just burns time between led state
changes by counting to some number.  It is not meant to be a precise
time in any way, just enough time so you can see it blink.
